## Serving locally (for development)

    $ . ./dev_env.sh
    $ npm run rebuild
    $ npm run serve

## Javascript Object Graphs

Explore the object graph exposed by a browser's Javascript environment.

### Exploring data

While serving locally visit `localhost:8000/analyze_og.html`. This tool
allows you to select browser environments to include and exclude, and then
look at the APIs and structures in the resulting environment.

E.g., What APIs and structures exist in the set...

    (1) Safari 602.1.38 OSX 10.12

        âˆ©

    (2) Edge 14.14300 Windows 10.0

        \

    (3) Firefox 48.0 Windows 10.0

        \

    (4) Chrome 52.0.2743.116 OSX 10.11.6

I.e., in both `(1)` and `(2)`, but not in either `(3)` or `(4)`.

### Collecting data

#### Manual data collection setup

While serving locally visit `localhost:8000/index.html`. Use the buttons to
collect and then save data about your environment.

*NOTE*: This will (over)write `data/og/window_[platform/browser info].json`.

#### Automated data collection

Data collection can be automated via Selenium. The preferred method is to use
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com), but the data collection
interface is also implemented [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com), and custom
(local) Selenium instances.

##### Setup: BrowserStack

Add the following to `dev_env.local.sh` in your local checkout:

```zsh
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="your_browserstack_username"
BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="your_browserstack_access_key"
BROWSERSTACK_VIDEO="true" # "false" or unset saves time by recording no video

export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY
export BROWSERSTACK_VIDEO

SELENIUM_HOST="browserstack"

export SELENIUM_HOST
```

Install
[BrowserStackLocal](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#command-line)
for local tunneling magic. Now run it; e.g.:

    $ BrowserStackLocal -k your_browserstack_access_key

Open `browserstack_envs.json` and make sure it lists exactly the browsers you
wish to gather data from.

Skip to *Gathering the data* below.

##### Setup: SauceLabs

Add the following to `dev_env.local.sh` in your local checkout:

```zsh
SAUCE_USERNAME="your_sauce_username"
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="your_sauce_access_key"
SAUCE_PATH="/wd/hub"

# Tunnel from localhost via sauce-connect
SAUCE_HOST="localhost"
SAUCE_PORT="4445"

SELENIUM_HOST="sauce"

export SELENIUM_HOST
```

Install
[sauce-connect](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Setting+Up+Sauce+Connect)
for local URL proxying. Now run it; e.g.:

    $ sc

Open `sauce_envs.json` and make sure it lists exactly the browsers you wish
to gather data from.

Skip to *Gathering the data* below.

##### Setup: Custom Selenium

Add the following to `dev_env.local.sh` in your local checkout:

```zsh
SELENIUM_HOST="selenium_custom"

export SELENIUM_HOST
```

Take a look at `selenium_custom.js`. Make sure everything looks right (in
particular, double check the `url` for connecting to Selenium).

Open `selenium_custom_envs.json` and make sure it lists exactly the browsers
you wish to gather data from.

Skip to *Gathering the data* below.

##### Gathering the data

Make sure your development environment is up-to-date, then run the data
gathering script:

    $ . ./dev_env.sh
    $ node selenium_og.js

*NOTE*: You can override `SELENIUM_HOST` with one of `browserstack`, `sauce`,
 or `selenium_custom` by passing it to `selenium_og.js`. E.g., run `node
 selenium_og.js browserstack`.

## Web IDL

Explore [WebIDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) fragments.

*NOTE*: Some of the scripts referenced in this section require [ag -- The
 Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

### Exploring data

While serving locally visit `localhost:8000/analyze_idl.html`. This tool
allows you to select two WebIDL collections stored in `data/idl/...` , and
then look at the diff between IDL fragments that have the same name.

E.g., to view the difference between the `Node` interface linked in Blink's IDL
files (i.e., the interface from the spec) and the `Node` interface in Blink's
IDL files themselves: Enter "Left"=`blink linked`, "Choose interface"=`Node`,
"Right"=`blink`.

Each `<input>` element is bound to a dynamically updated `<datalist>` element,
so using the dropdown and/or auto-complete allow you to see what IDL collections
and interfaces are available.

### Bulk load

Bulk loading from several repositories and collections of web standards has
been scripted, but fidelity is not up-to-snuff in some collections. Each
collection is imported using a `*_import.sh` script, each of which has a
corresponding `.js` script. `*_urls_import.sh` scripts attempt to scrape IDL
from markup fetched from URLs, rather than operating over `.idl` files
directly. Import scripts cache URL fetches in `.urlcache/` and IDL parses in
`.idlcache/`.

#### URL import example: Importing from URLs mentioned in Blink's data

This import example requires the `unbuffer` and Selenium WebDriver with
ChromeDriver.

##### Environment setup

Make sure you have `unbuffer` installed. If you're unsure, look for non-empty
output from:

    $ which unbuffer

Also, make sure you have Selenium WebDriver and ChromeDriver installed. Take
note of the `jar` file associated with each. Add the following to
`selenium_custom_server.local.sh` in your local checkout:

```zsh
SELENIUM_JAR=/path/to/selenium/web-driver/jar
CHROME_DRIVER=/path/to/chrome-driver

export SELENIUM_JAR
export CHROME_DRIVER
```

Now run (and leave running) `selenium_custom_server.sh` with something like
`zsh selenium_custom_server.sh` or `bash selenium_custom_server.sh`.

##### Collecting the data

Invoke `blink_idl_urls_import.sh` by running something like `zsh
./blink_idl_urls_import.sh` or `bash ./blink_idl_urls_import.sh`. There will
be lots of output, most of which is also written to
`data/idl/blink/linked/log`.

*NOTE*: This will overwrite
 `data/idl/caniuse/linked/{all.json|processed.json|log}`.

This will also take a long time; minutes, not hours. If it hangs completely,
try setting and exporting `NUM_SELENIUM_SESSIONS_PER_NODE` and
`NUM_SELENIUM_NODES` in `selenium_custom_server.local.sh`.


#### Local repository import example: Importing Blink's WebIDL

First, make sure you have a checkout of Blink. You can either use an existing
checkout of the Chromium source code (and point to `third_party/WebKit`) or
do the following to checkout Chromium, keeping only the Blink source:

    $ mkdir blink
    $ cd blink
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
    $ git config core.sparsecheckout true
    $ echo "third_party/WebKit/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
    $ git pull --depth=1 origin master

At a minimum, set the following environment variable(s):

```zsh
BLINK_SRC_DIR=/path/to/blink/third_party/WebKit
```

Continuing from Blink source checkout example:

    $ export BLINK_SRC_DIR=$(pwd)/third_party/WebKit

Next, run `blink_idl_import.sh` using something like `zsh
./blink_idl_import.sh` or `bash blink_idl_import.sh`. *NOTE*: This will
overwrite `data/idl/blink/all.json`. Exactly one parse failure is expected.

To also import from URLs linked in Blink's IDL files, run
`blink_idl_urls_import.sh`. *NOTE*: This will yield a lot of logging messages
and will overwrite `data/idl/blink/linked/all.json`.
